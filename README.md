muscles.css
===========

A flexbox based modular layout css toolkit. Easily add flexbox layouts to your
app or site without having to write css.

Inspired by [inuitcss layout](https://github.com/inuitcss/objects.layout) and
inuit style css.

**Disclaimer**: This is very much a work in progress and I do not recommend
using it in production just yet.

Goals
-----

The goals of this are to provide a simple, flexible, modular set of classes
that can be quickly added to your html. 

* be as easy to use as any common grid system
* require very little superfluous markup (ideally none) allowing for style on 
  flex containers and items when possible
* be usable for general page/app layout and specific ui/component layout
* use modular approach to css class names
